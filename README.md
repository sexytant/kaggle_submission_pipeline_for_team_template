# kaggle_submission_pipeline_for_team_template

This repository is influenced by [kaggle_submission_pipeline_template](https://github.com/wakamezake/kaggle_submission_pipeline_template).
The difference between this template and this one is that we have added GithubActions to submit the code using the KaggleAPI.

## Example
This repository has been generated using a [kaggle_submission_pipeline_for_team_template](https://github.com/sexytant/kaggle_submission_pipeline_for_team_template).
Here's a link between the repository created using this template and the Kaggle Notebook generated by GithubActions.

- [Kaggle - Store-Sales-TimeSeriesForecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/tadashikojima/store-sales-timeseriesforecasting)

## Correctional point
Here's a summary of the modifications to be made when using a template.

### Code
- Change name of the directory **easy_gold** to **{my_package_name}**

### Github Secrets
Set an API token in Github Secrets before running Github Actions.
See [Kaggle Public API](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api) to generate an API token.

> In order to use the Kaggle’s public API, you must first authenticate using an API token. From the site header, click on your user profile picture, then on “My Account” from the dropdown menu. This will take you to your account settings at https://www.kaggle.com/account. Scroll down to the section of the page labelled API:
To create a new token, click on the “Create New API Token” button. This will download a fresh authentication token onto your machine.

See [Github - encrypted-secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) about Github Secrets.

Set the Name and Value(listed in the API token) as shown below.

|  Name  |  Value  |
| ---- | ---- |
|  KAGGLE_USERNAME_(n)  |  Listed in the API token for n-th user  |
|  KAGGLE_KEY_(n)  |  Listed in the API token for n-th user  |

### Github Action([upload_user(n).yml](https://github.com/wakamezake/kaggle_submission_pipeline_template/blob/master/.github/workflows/upload_user1.yml))
To be built the kernel, specify the prefix build trigger for each user in the name of the n-th user's branch.
